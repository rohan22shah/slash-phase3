## 🪲 Reporting Bugs
This section guides you through submitting a bug report for this repository. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports. Before creating bug reports, please perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. Note: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in the template.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help a developer reproduce the problem:
*	Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
*	Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. Along with it, provide the details regarding the name and version of OS, Python version, configuration of the environment, if used any.
*	Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/paste able snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
*	Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
*	Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
*	If the problem is related to performance or memory, include details of the errors encountered with your report.
*	Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

### Before Submitting A Bug Report

Please check existing bug reports instead of opening a new one. There is a possibility that there are fixes already posted for bugs. If not, you are welcome to submit a bug report and we will look into it as soon as possible.

## 🙇 Pull Requests
1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the [README.md](https://github.com/Urvashi74/slash/blob/main/README.md) with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the [README.md](https://github.com/Urvashi74/slash/blob/main/README.md) to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is SemVer.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## 👒 Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages
*	Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
*	Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
*	Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
*	Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
*	When only changing documentation, include [ci skip] in the commit title

### Git Branching Naming Convention
Not using appropriate naming conventions leads to confusion and complicates the code maintenance team. We can’t ignore Git best practices in branching naming conventions.

- Main (main) is the default branch available in the Git repository. It should be stable all the time and won’t allow any direct check-in. You can only merge it after code review. All team members are responsible for keeping the master stable and up-to-date.

- <b>Make sure the new branch you create follows proper naming conventions.</b>
```<author>-<date in (DD-MMMM) format>-<short-feature-description>```
<br> E.g., rahil-6-sept-test-badge
E.g., moksh-7-sept-web-scraping

This method allows for easy tracking of different developers’ work and progress with additional systems.
